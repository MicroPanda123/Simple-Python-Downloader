# Simple-Python-Downloader
Simple python program that can be used to download files, and show progress bar, in which you can use your own scale (for example instead of KB or MB or B, if you want you can download chunks of sizes like 69 Bytes, or 420 Bytes if you find it funny)

That's one of my first project when i started with programming, and this code is probably very messy, but fact that it's old project that i abondoned it really long time ago, i decided that i won't do any changes and just publish this here.

# Usage
You simply type  `python download.py (link to file to download)`
and if you want you can change scale (KB default) by adding `--chunk_size (Scale you want to use)`
and then progress bar will update everytime that amount of Bytes was downloaded.

So yeah that's it. Have fun of my messy code.
